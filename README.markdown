# Data Science Capstone: SpaceX Launch Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the code and deliverables for the Coursera Data Science Capstone Project, focusing on analyzing SpaceX launch data to uncover success factors and predict mission outcomes. The project follows a comprehensive data science pipeline, including data collection, wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), interactive visualizations, and predictive modeling.

## Repository Contents
- **Notebooks**:
  - `SpaceX_API.ipynb`: Data collection via SpaceX REST API.
  - `Web_Scraping.ipynb`: Web scraping for additional launch data.
  - `Data_Wrangling.ipynb`: Cleaning and preprocessing raw data.
  - `EDA_Visualization.ipynb`: Visualizations (e.g., scatter, bar, line charts).
  - `EDA_SQL.ipynb`: SQL queries for insights (e.g., payload, landing outcomes).
  - `Folium_Map.ipynb`: Interactive maps for launch sites and outcomes.
  - `Plotly_Dash.ipynb`: Interactive dashboard for success and payload analysis.
  - `Predictive_Analysis.ipynb`: Classification models to predict launch success.
- **Presentation**:

## Key Features
- **Data Collection**: Sourced launch data using SpaceX API and web scraping.
- **EDA**: Visualized trends (e.g., success rates by orbit) and queried data (e.g., payload by booster).
- **Interactive Analytics**: Built Folium maps and a Plotly Dash dashboard for dynamic exploration.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Developed and tuned classification models to predict mission success.
- **Findings**: Identified top launch sites, optimal payload ranges, and high-accuracy models.
